1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git file is added to the directory. This file is used to keep track of all the commits made to the file(s).

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is used to add only the files from the working directory which will have changes made in the current commit. This is useful because you can separate the commited files logically from the entire working directory.
