1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden .git file is added to the directory. This file is used to keep track of all the commits made to the file(s).

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is used to add only the files from the working directory which will have changes made in the current commit. This is useful because you can separate the commited files logically from the entire working directory.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By only adding files from the repository which are part of the same logical change to the staging area, we make sure not to commit changes to any other files.

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?

Branches are helpful when adding an experimental feature which might not end up in the final application, while still updating and fixing the original branch. Also branches can be used to make multiple similar versions of the application but still different (different language, difficulty level etc.).
