1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If there are more people working on a project, or when you need to access your work from another computer or most likely both.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if someone else was doing work on the remote repository, I wouldn't necessarily want this work to be pulled to my local computer and be surprised the next time I start doing work on my machine. In general work done on the remote repository is not always work I would want pulled.
